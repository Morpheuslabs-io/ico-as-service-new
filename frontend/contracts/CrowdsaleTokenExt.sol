 * A crowdsaled token.
 * An ERC-20 token designed specifically for crowdsales with investor protection and further development path.
 * - The token transfer() is disabled until the crowdsale is over
 * - The token contract gives an opt-in upgrade path to a new contract
 * - The same token can be part of several crowdsales through approve() mechanism
 * - The token can be capped (supply set in the constructor) or uncapped (crowdsale contract can mint new tokens)
